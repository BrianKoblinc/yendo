# Mobile Adaptation Strategy

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

### Core PWA Requirements
- **Service Worker**: Offline functionality and caching
- **Web App Manifest**: App-like installation experience
- **HTTPS**: Secure connection requirement
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

### PWA Implementation
```typescript
// Service Worker for offline support
const CACHE_NAME = 'cultural-events-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/static/js/bundle.js',
  '/static/css/main.css',
  '/api/events'
];

// Web App Manifest
{
  "name": "Cultural Events",
  "short_name": "Events",
  "description": "Discover and manage cultural events",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Mobile App Architecture

### React Native Considerations
- **Shared Business Logic**: Core services and utilities
- **Platform-Specific UI**: Native components for each platform
- **State Management**: Redux/MobX for cross-platform state
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for mobile routing

### Flutter Considerations
- **Single Codebase**: Write once, run anywhere
- **Performance**: Native compilation for both platforms
- **UI Consistency**: Material Design and Cupertino widgets
- **Hot Reload**: Fast development iteration

## Mobile-Specific Features

### Offline Capabilities
- **Event Caching**: Store event data locally
- **Offline Browsing**: View cached events without internet
- **Sync on Reconnect**: Update data when online
- **Offline Calendar**: Local calendar management

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch Interactions**: Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe, pinch, tap gestures
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile hardware
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimize background processing

### Platform Integration
- **Calendar Sync**: Native calendar integration
- **Push Notifications**: Event reminders and updates
- **Location Services**: GPS for nearby events
- **Social Sharing**: Native sharing capabilities

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: PWA Development
1. Implement responsive web design
2. Add service worker for offline support
3. Create web app manifest
4. Test PWA installation

### Phase 2: Mobile App Planning
1. Choose mobile framework (React Native/Flutter)
2. Design mobile-specific UI/UX
3. Plan API adaptations for mobile
4. Set up mobile development environment

### Phase 3: Mobile App Development
1. Implement core mobile features
2. Add platform-specific integrations
3. Optimize for performance
4. Test on both platforms

## Code Sharing Strategy
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript interfaces for data models
- **Shared Services**: API calls and business logic
- **Shared Utils**: Helper functions and constants
- **Platform-Specific**: UI components and navigation
